## Ideas to improve app

- Add unit tests
- Use virtualized lists for displaying countries / cities because sometimes it takes a lot of time to render many elements (USA cities)
- Some cities are not recognized from countriesnow.space api. Improvement should be to use api which provides not only country name, but coordinates too and use coordinates instead of city name with openweathermap api.
- Improve text color contrast
