# Front-end Software Engineer Challenge (Weather App)

**Project target:** Create a single page application (SPA) according to the functional and technical requirements.

### Functional requirements:

- City categorization by country name.
- Search by city name.
- Show weather by the current device location.
- Display weather not only as a textual content widget but also on the map (Google maps or similar).
- Remember your favorite cities.
- Get data from the free weather API.

### Technical requirements:

- Use JavaScript framework (React). You can use TypeScript if you want to.
- Use CSS preprocessor (Sass, Less, etc.).
- Apply mobile-first methodology for styles. Do not use Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar frameworks.
- Ensure that the page is displayed neatly on both mobile devices and modern browsers.
- The production code must be optimized.

### Guidelines of the implementation process:

- The code must be placed on GitHub. There must be a short document describing how to start the project. Having the project accessible live would be nice to have.
- Commit the code early and often to demonstrate how you break down and iteratively solve the problem.
